## Gumbel-(Soft)max sampling

This repository contains the file _notebook_fig4.ipynb_, which is a jupyter notebook that accompagnies Figure 4 of the paper
[A Review of the Gumbel-max Trick and its Extensions for Discrete Stochasticity in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01515)

This notebook can be used to gain insights in the relations between Gumbel-max and Gumbel-softmax samples, generated from unnormalized logits or normalized probabilities.

It has been tested on a Windows system in an anaconda environment with Python 3.6.7, numpy 1.17.3 and scipy 1.5.4.
